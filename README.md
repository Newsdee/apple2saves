# Apple II Saves Folder

This is a collection of pre-formatted (but empty) .nib files to help you save data on emulators,
while keeping your collection of saves separate from your main .dsk or .woz files.

Some games such as Ultima II require one disk per character, which need to be reformatted if your character dies.
In this case there are multiple disks provided, to be used as separate save slots without having to reformat every time you die
