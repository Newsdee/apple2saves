# Apple II Saves Folder

This is a collection of pre-formatted (but empty) .nib files to help you save data on emulators,
while keeping your collection of saves separate from your main .dsk or .woz files.

Some games such as Ultima II require one disk per character, which need to be reformatted if your character dies.
In this case there are multiple disks provided, to be used as separate save slots without having to reformat every time you need to restart.

## Other (non-game) disks

A few disks are provided that are not game specific:

* blank .nib disk, made from emptying a DOS 3.3 Master disk with Ciderpress
* one blank .nib is to house your BASIC programs
* two 'scratch' disks are provided to be used with diagnostic tools (they are not meant to store data long term)
